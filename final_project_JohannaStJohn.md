# Final Project Part 2

## Initial Wireframe

While beginning my research and developing a more complete wireframe, I realised that I was trying to cram too much information into the alotted space. For this reason, I ended up cutting out the second half of my original proposal with suggested actions, and simply focusing on why it matters for people to engage in individual action. These changes are reflected in my [initial wireframe](https://johannastjohn29.wixsite.com/storieswithdata/final-project).

## User Research Protocal and Findings

### User Research Questions

1. How do you feel at the end?
2. Did any points of it feel redundant or over-emphasized?
3. Did anything feel under-emphasized?
4. From the four short study descriptions used at the end, did any of them especially resonate with you?
5. Do you have any thoughts of visuals that would help you understand or picture the studies?
6. Any other feedback?


### User 1
#### 1. How do you feel at the end?
More enlightened and slightly more hopeful because we have good systems to capitalize on social norms. See social media and marketing

#### 2. Did any points of it feel redundant or over-emphasized?
No. Very visual heavy, but not many at the end.
  
#### 3. Did anything feel under-emphasized?
   No

#### 4. From the four short study descriptions used at the end, did any of them especially resonate with you?
The last one - 4000 households. It’s something that applies to everyone regardless of political/environmental beliefs.

#### 5. Do you have any thoughts of visuals that would help you understand or picture the studies?
Make a graphic of the 4 reasons why people were told. The last highlighted in green and the others in red.
Happy and neutral face for Psychology Journal. 
Take out solar panel study because the results could theoretically be due to other factors, like wealth of the residents or zoning or city policies.

#### 6. Any other feedback?
In the electricity study by the journal, distinguish that they tracked electricity. It seemed like energy could be referring to personal energy, since I was just talking about emotions.


### User 2

#### 1. How do you feel at the end?
Empowered

#### 2. Did any points of it feel redundant or over-emphasized?
No

#### 3. Did anything feel under-emphasized?
No

#### 4. From the four short study descriptions used at the end, did any of them especially resonate with you?
The last four

#### 5. Do you have any thoughts of visuals that would help you understand or picture the studies?
Infographic

#### 6. Any other feedback?
No


### User 3

#### 1. How do you feel at the end?
I feel frustrated because it seems that collective efforts will help the environment, but how much influence do us average joes have?

#### 2. Did any points of it feel redundant or over-emphasized?
At the information starting around “…Diego” and onward, I think the information can be truncated

#### 3. Did anything feel under-emphasized?
Maybe information on where the first data visualizations come from to help you credibility

#### 4. From the four short study descriptions used at the end, did any of them especially resonate with you?
An online survey showed that of the respondents who know someone who had given up flying because of climate change, half of them said they flew less as a result.

#### 5. Do you have any thoughts of visuals that would help you understand or picture the studies?
Be careful that the title “But as of 2016, only 6% actually think humans can and will reduce Climate Change.” gets cut off with the visual. If you provided links be careful that the reader can see the links (perhaps use an accent color). Could you put a color association with the graph “But as of 2016, only 6% actually think humans can and will reduce Climate Change.”? It’s not all positive so the blue/green doesn’t visually accent that.

#### 6. Any other feedback?
No


# Final Project Part 3

## Intended Audience

The intended audience for this story is fairly broad. While everyone is impacted by Climate Change, this presentation seeks to show audience members that their actions count. However, in order for someone to believe that their actions can make a difference, they need to believe in Climate Change in the first place. For this reason, the story is geared toward everyone who acknowledges the existence and danger of Climate Change.

Primarily I expect that interested audiences would comprise those in younger generations who are more likely to be impacted by our changing climate, as well as educated demographics, who are more likely to be swayed by a data-based argument. 

## Reflections

I was surprised by the large changes I ended up making in each stage of the planning process and each iteration of the story. Beginning with the research portion of the project, in which I collected the necessary data, I was shocked by the amount that was out there, not only about Climate Change, but also about sociological and pshycological factors that come to play in the issue and humanity's response to it. This is one of the primary reasons that I ended up cutting my original proposal in half, focusing just on why individual action matters, rather than including the measured impact of different actions. While it could have potentially been useful to audiences to have this information as well, I felt that it was information that was much more readily available, while there is much skepticisim as to the impact individuals can have in general. I found that paring down the scope allowed me to provide more substantial evidence to this point, rather than glossing over it with just one or two data points. It also allowed me to show that this is a real issue many people come across in the way they think about Climate Change, rather than just making that assumption and assuming that the audience is on the same page. 

Another decision I made as the project developed was to include graphics in places that weren't necessarily illustrating the data, but still coincided with the story. I found that this not only helped with visual flow of the project, but it also helped to further engage viewers. This is especially important for people who may not have the desire or time to spend reading a long article, but want to quickly understand the information.

I certainly learned the importance of user research and came to value how much change and realization can happen simply through creating multiple iterations. Since working on this project, I've also begun to see the many places that visualizations are used to strengthen stories and have become more adept at recognizing places where they aren't but could be used well to the benefit of the story.
